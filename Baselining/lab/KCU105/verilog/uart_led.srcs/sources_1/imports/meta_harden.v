//
//  Description: 
//    This is a basic meta-stability hardener; it double synchronizes an
//    asynchronous signal onto a new clock domain.
//
//  Parameters:
//    None
//
//  Notes       : 
//
//  Multicycle and False Paths, Timing Exceptions
//    A tighter timing constraint should be placed between the signal_meta
//    and signal_dst flip-flops to allow for meta-stability settling time
//
