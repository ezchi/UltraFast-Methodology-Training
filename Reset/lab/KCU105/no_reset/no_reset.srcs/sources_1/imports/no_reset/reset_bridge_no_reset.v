// Description:
//---------------------------------------------------------------------  
//    This is a specialized metastability hardener intended for use in the
//    reset path. The reset will assert ASYNCHRONOUSLY when the input reset is
//    asserted, but will deassert synchronously.
//
//    In designs with asynchronous reset flip-flops, this generates a reset
//    that can meet the "recovery time" requirement of the flip-flop (be sure
//    to enable the recovery time arc checking - ENABLE=reg_sr_r).
//
//    In designs with synchronous resets, it ensures that the reset is
//    available before the first valid clock pulse arrives.
//
//   NOTE: Multicycle and False Paths, Timing Exceptions
//    A tighter timing constraint should be placed between the rst_meta
//    and rst_dst flip-flops to allow for meta-stability settling time
//
