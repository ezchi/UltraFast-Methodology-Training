-- comment:
--   Generates a 16x Baud enable. This signal is generated 16 times per  bit
--   at the correct baud rate as determined by the parameters for the  system
--   clock frequency and the Baud  rate
--   
-- 1) Divider must be at least 2 (thus CLOCK_RATE must be at least 32x
--   BAUD_RATE)
