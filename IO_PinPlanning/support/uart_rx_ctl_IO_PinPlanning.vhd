-- comment:
--   UART receiver  controller
--   Implements the state machines for doing RS232  reception.
--   
-- Based on the detection of the falling edge of the synchronized  rxd
--   input, this module waits 1/2 of a bit period (8 periods of  baud_x16_en)
--   to find the middle of the start bit, and resamples it. If rxd  
--   is still low it accepts it as a valid START bit, and captures the  rest
--   of the character, otherwise it rejects the start bit and returns  to
--    idle.
--   
-- After detecting the START bit, it advances 1 full bit period at a  time
--   (16 periods of baud_x16_en) to end up in the middle of the 8  data
--   bits, where it samples the 8 data bits.  
--   
-- After the last bit is sampled (the MSbit, since the LSbit is  sent
--   first), it waits one additional bit period to check for the STOP  bit.
--   If the rxd line is not high (the value of a STOP bit), a framing  error
--   is signalled. Regardless of the value of the rxd, though, the  module
--   returns to the IDLE state and immediately begins looking for the  
--   start of the next  character.
--   
-- NOTE: The total cycle time through the state machine is 9 1/2  bit
--   periods (not 10) - this allows for a mismatch between the transmit  and
--   receive clock rates by as much as  5%.
--   
-- Multicycle and False  Paths
--   All flip-flops within this module share the same chip enable,  generated
--   by the Baud rate generator. Hence, all paths from FFs to FFs in  this
--   module are multicycle paths.
