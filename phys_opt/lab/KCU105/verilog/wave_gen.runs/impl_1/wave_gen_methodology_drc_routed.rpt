2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell clk_gen_i0/rst_meta_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_rx_i0/rst_dst_reg/PRE,
rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_rx_i0/rst_meta_reg/PRE,
rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_samp_i0/rst_dst_reg/PRE,
rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_samp_i0/rst_meta_reg/PRE,
rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_tx_i0/rst_dst_reg/PRE
rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_tx_i0/rst_meta_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#1 Warning
False path, asynchronous clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between synchronous clocks  
A Max Delay Datapath Only timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks clk_out1_clk_core_phys_opt and clk_out2_clk_core_phys_opt (see constraint position 30 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via  set_false_path, set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 3.333 -name clk_pin_p -waveform {0.000 1.666} [get_ports clk_pin_p] (Source: /home/amd/training/phys_opt/lab/KCU105/verilog/wave_gen.srcs/constrs_1/imports/wave_gen_timing_phys_opt.xdc (Line: 2))
Previous: create_clock -period 3.333 [get_ports clk_pin_p] (Source: /home/amd/training/phys_opt/lab/KCU105/verilog/wave_gen.gen/sources_1/ip/clk_core_phys_opt/clk_core_phys_opt.xdc (Line: 56))
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 3.333 -name clk_pin_p -waveform {0.000 1.666} [get_ports clk_pin_p] (Source: /home/amd/training/phys_opt/lab/KCU105/verilog/wave_gen.srcs/constrs_1/imports/wave_gen_timing_phys_opt.xdc (Line: 2))

Related violations: <none>

CLKC-9#1 Advisory
BUFGCE with active CE has BUFG driver  
The BUFGCE cell clk_gen_i0/BUFGCE_clk_samp_i0 clk_gen_i0/BUFGCE_clk_samp_i0/I pin (and CE is ACTIVE) is driven by BUFGCE clock buffer clk_gen_i0/clk_core_i0/inst/clkout2_buf. Please review your clocking topology. If this cascaded clocking topology is desired to meet the clock enable timing requirements, then this methodology check can be waived. If this cascaded clocking topology is not desired, it should be reconnected in parallel to the driving clock buffer in order to reduce skew. Cascaded buffers introduce skew that can lead to difficult or impossible timing closure.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-23#1 Advisory
MMCME3 with ZHOLD drives sequential IO not with CLKOUT0  
The MMCME3 cell clk_gen_i0/clk_core_i0/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst has COMPENSATION value ZHOLD, but CLKOUT1 output drives sequential IO cells. In order to achieve insertion delay and phase-alignment for the IO sequential cells, CLKOUT0 must be used.
Related violations: <none>
